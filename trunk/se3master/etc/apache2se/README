Apache2 Configuration under Debian GNU/Linux
============================================

Debian's default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and
removing modules, virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as
flexible is possible, in order to make automating the changes and
administering the server as easy as possible.

Files and Directories in /etc/apache2:
-------------------------------------

apache2.conf

	This is the main configuration file.

conf.d/

	Files in this directory are included by this line in
	apache2.conf:

	# Include generic snippets of statements
	Include /etc/apache2/conf.d

	This is a good place to add additional configuration
	directives.

httpd.conf

	Empty file.

magic

	Magic data for mod_mime_magic Apache module, documented in
	htdocs/manual/mod/mod_mime_magic.html.  You probably don't
	need to touch this.

mods-available/

	This directory contains a series of .load and .conf files.
	The .load files contain the Apache configuration directive
	necessary to load the module in question.  The respective
	.conf files contain configuration directives necessary to
	utilize the module in question.

mods-enabled/

	To actually enable a module for Apache2, it is necessary to
	create a symlink in this directory to the .load (and .conf, if
	it exists) files associated with the module in
	mods-available/.  For example:

	cgi.load -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load

ports.conf

	Configuration directives for which ports and IP addresses to
	listen to.

sites-available/

	Like mods-available/, except it contains configuration
	directives for different virtual hosts that might be used with
	apache2.  Note that the hostname doesn't have to correspond
	exactly with the filename.  'default' is the default host.

sites-enabled/

	Similar in functionality to mods-enabled/, sites-enabled
	contains symlinks to sites in sites-available/ that the
	admnistrator wishes to enable.

	Example:
	dedasys -> /etc/apache2/sites-available/dedasys

Tools
-----

Currently, a2enmod and a2dismod are available for enabling and
disabling modules utilizing the above configuration system.

a2ensite and a2dissite have been added, which do essentially the
same thing as the above tools, but for sites rather than modules.
