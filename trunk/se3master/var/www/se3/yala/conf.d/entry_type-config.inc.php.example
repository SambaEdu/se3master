# Entry Types
#
# entry_types are yala's way to describe an entry type (i.e. 'user')
# by several objectclasses which always build it.
# This is used both for yala to recognize such objects and give them a
# special icon, and both for allowing easy add of entry of that type.
#
# Note: objectclass names are case insensitive.
# Note: 'custom' is already a registered Entry Type, don't use it.
