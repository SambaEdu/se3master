Installation
------------
Installation should be really simple.. Just untar the package into somewhere
accessible by your web server, and edit config.inc.php file.
YALA files can (must??) be read-only for the web server, it only needs write access into CACHE_PATH (defined in config.inc.php) directory.

We assume you already have a web browser working and configured with php
support.

For help in installing php on your web server, please refer to php.net.



Upgrading
---------
While upgrading don't forget to read the ChangeLog. You'll probably want to
keep using your old configuration file, but there might've been changes in
this file in the new version. Such changes will be reported in the 
ChangeLog.
