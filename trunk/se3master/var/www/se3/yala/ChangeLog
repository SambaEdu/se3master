Version 0.29 (4/11/2003)
------------------------
- CONFIGURATION FILE(s) WERE CHANGED, please use all the .example files
  and reconfigure them as you will.
  configuration is now more modular and was made so next versions you could
  still use your current configurations.

- objectclass names are now case insensitive. Thanks to Sven Carstens.

- mv yala.php main.php;  to avoid confusions.
  (config.inc.php must be upgraded for that reason as well)

- Better code, lots of rewrites to avoid php NOTICE warnings.
  Thanks to Claudio Thomas for pointing that out

- .GIFs -> .PNGs

- Improved schema finding algorithm, we can access Active Directory again now.

- More eye-candy stuff, CSS


Version 0.28 (07/10/2003)
-------------------------
- Graphic changes (new images, nice error msgs, CSS..)

- Supports non-numerical OIDs.
 
- Added README.security. Read it.

- Other small fixes.


Version 0.21 (27/07/2003)
-------------------------
- Updated login_form.inc.php which wasn't included in 0.20 by a mistake.
  0.20 was a bad release (well, even linux had 2.4.11...)


Version 0.20 (26/07/2003)
-------------------------
- TLS support was added (Thanks to Brian Jones), which also added a new
  configuration option to config.inc.php: LDAP_TLS.

- Lots of problems with special characters and i18n were fixed,
  thanks to Dave for both reporting and giving many useful advices.

- the value '0' isn't treated empty anymore, thanks to omegahacker's
  bug report.

- Few more bugs where fixed


Version 0.12 (18/04/2003)
-------------------------
- We do NOT require 'register_globals = on' in php.ini anymore. This solves
  the 'unable to login' problem which was reported by many people.

- The code doesn't check if the icon exist for each icon, but creates a list
  of icons in advance and increases the efficiency.

- config.inc.php has a new define(), DEFAULT_ICON: please synchronize it
  with your older configuration.


Version 0.11 (14/03/2003)
-----------------------
Initial Public Release
